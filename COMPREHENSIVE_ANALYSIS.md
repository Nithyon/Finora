---

## 2. CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND

### üî¥ MAJOR BUGS

#### Issue 1: Missing Error Handling in Analytics
**File:** `app/analytics/page.tsx`
- Assumes Java service running on port 8081
- No fallback when service unavailable
- User sees cryptic error message
- **Fix:** Show graceful degradation, use localStorage fallbacks

#### Issue 2: Data Sync Problems
**Problem:** Multiple data sources (localStorage vs API vs Context)
- Transactions stored in localStorage & API
- No sync mechanism between sources
- Data can get out of sync
- **Fix:** Implement single source of truth

#### Issue 3: Budget Calculation Inconsistency
**Files:** `app/page.tsx`, `app/spending/page.tsx`, `app/budget/page.tsx`
- Different files calculate budgets differently
- Some include virtual account transactions, some don't
- No unified spending calculation
- **Fix:** Create shared utility function

#### Issue 4: Missing Transaction Linking
- Virtual bank transactions not linked to spending categories
- No way to know which account a transaction belongs to
- Budget alerts don't account for virtual accounts
- **Fix:** Unified transaction model with account references

#### Issue 5: Goal Tracking Missing
- `/reflect` page exists but no goal progress tracking
- Can't see "how fast to reach goal" or "days to target"
- No visualization of goal progress
- **Fix:** Add goal computation utilities

## 3. UX/FEATURE GAPS (vs YNAB)

### Missing YNAB Concepts

1. **Rule 1: Give Every Dollar a Job**
   - Budget doesn't reflect "available to assign" properly
   - No "to be assigned" indicator
   - **Impact:** Users don't know if they're over-budgeting

2. **Rule 2: Embrace Your True Expenses**
   - No monthly vs yearly expense tracking
   - Can't divide annual expense by 12
   - **Impact:** Users overspend on irregular expenses

3. **Rule 3: Roll With The Punches**
   - No budget adjustment after overspending
   - No "overspend tracking" across months
   - **Impact:** Can't learn from past overspending

4. **Rule 4: Age Your Money**
   - No income tracking
   - Can't see "when will I have enough for next month"
   - **Impact:** Money stress not addressed

### Missing Analytics Features

1. **Goal Progress Dashboard**
   - No "days to goal" calculation
   - No "overspend impact" on goal date
   - No "if I increase spending by X%" projection

2. **Spending Velocity**
   - No "burn rate" - how fast money is spent
   - No projection: "at current pace, budget exhausted in X days"
   - No warning: "on pace to overspend by ‚Çπ5000"

3. **Trend Analysis**
   - No month-to-month comparison per category
   - No "you're spending 20% more on groceries"
   - No seasonal pattern detection

4. **Smart Alerts**
   - Only alerts when budget % exceeded
   - Should alert on anomalies
   - Should warn before running out

---

## 4. CODE QUALITY ISSUES

### Type Safety
- ‚ùå Many `any` types in Context
- ‚ùå Inconsistent Transaction types
- ‚ùå No validation on API responses

### Error Handling
- ‚ùå Silent failures in useEffect
- ‚ùå No try-catch in some async operations
- ‚ùå User doesn't know why things fail

### Performance
- ‚ùå No memoization in expensive calculations
- ‚ùå Recomputing budgets on every render
- ‚ùå No debouncing on input

### Testing
- ‚ùå No automated tests
- ‚ùå No validation of calculations
- ‚ùå Manual testing required

## 7. YNAB FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT

### Feature: Spending Velocity
```typescript
const getSpendingVelocity = (transactions: Transaction[], days: number) => {
  const recent = transactions.filter(t => isWithinDays(t.date, days));
  const total = recent.reduce((sum, t) => sum + t.amount, 0);
  return total / days; // ‚Çπ per day
};

const daysUntilBudgetExhausted = (budget, spent, velocity) => {
  const remaining = budget - spent;
  return remaining / velocity;
};
```

### Feature: Goal Progress
```typescript
const getGoalProgress = (goal: Goal, transactions: Transaction[]) => {
  const towards = transactions
    .filter(t => t.category === goal.category)
    .reduce((sum, t) => sum + t.amount, 0);
  
  const daysRemaining = daysBetween(today, goal.deadline);
  const neededPerDay = (goal.target - towards) / daysRemaining;
  
  return {
    progress: towards / goal.target,
    percentComplete: (towards / goal.target) * 100,
    daysRemaining,
    neededPerDay,
    onTrack: towards >= (goal.target / goal.daysTotal) * goal.daysPassed,
  };
};
```

### Feature: Available to Assign
```typescript
const getAvailableToAssign = (income, budgets) => {
  const totalBudgeted = budgets.reduce((sum, b) => sum + b.amount, 0);
  return income - totalBudgeted;
};
```
