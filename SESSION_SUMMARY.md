## 🎯 What Was Accomplished

### Phase 1: Settings Accessibility (1/7 tasks)
**Goal**: Make Settings accessible from every page

**Implementation**:
```
✅ Added ⚙️ icon to all 6 page headers
✅ Icon links to /settings
✅ Consistent styling across pages
✅ Plus bottom navigation already had Settings
```

**Result**: Users can access Settings from anywhere in 2 ways:
1. Bottom navigation (6th icon)
2. Settings gear icon in page header

---

### Phase 2: Budget-Spending Connection (3/7 tasks)
**Goal**: Connect budget targets with spending tracking

**What We Did**:

#### Task 1: Connect Budget → Personalize Plan
- Home page saves income to localStorage
- Personalize Plan loads and uses this income
- Budget targets persist across sessions

#### Task 2: Connect Personalize Plan → Spending  
- Spending page loads budget targets from localStorage
- Shows budget vs actual spending per category
- Color-coded progress (green/yellow/red)
- Displays remaining budget or overspent amount

#### Task 3: Connect Spending → Home Dashboard
- Home page calculates actual spending from transactions
- Displays spending summary card
- Shows "Actual Spending" stat (✓ or ✗ colored)
- Quick link to detailed breakdown

**Result**: Complete budget tracking loop
```
Home Income → Personalize Plan Targets → Spending Tracking → Home Dashboard
```

---

### Phase 3: User Guidance & Integration (2/7 tasks)
**Goal**: Guide users and connect remaining features

#### Task 4: Chat Navigation Links
- Chatbot responses now include action links
- Links guide users to relevant pages
- Example: "📊 Personalize Your Plan" button in chat
- Fully clickable and navigable

#### Task 5: Reflect Goals Integration
- Loads budget targets from Personalize Plan
- Shows personal goals + budget targets
- Quick edit links back to Personalize Plan
- Visual progress tracking

---

### Phase 4: Account-Spending Connection (1/7 task)
**Goal**: Make Accounts page functional with spending

**Implementation**:
- Loads accounts from AppContext (backend)
- Calculates spending per account from transactions
- Shows account health indicator (% of balance spent)
- Color-coded: green (safe) → yellow (caution) → red (over)
- Quick stats: account count, total spending
- Links to Spending page for details
