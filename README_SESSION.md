## ⚠️ Known Limitations

**Phase 1 Scope:**
- No backend API integration (localStorage only)
- No user authentication beyond context
- No data export/import
- No multi-user support
- No mobile-specific optimizations

**These will be addressed in Phase 2 & 3**

## 🚀 Next Steps (Phase 2)

### Immediate (This Week)
1. Run comprehensive functional tests
2. Validate all calculations with real data
3. Test edge cases and error scenarios
4. UI/UX polish and refinement
5. Performance optimization

### Short Term (Next Sprint)
1. Implement YNAB Rules 3 & 4
2. Add recurring transactions
3. Budget history tracking
4. Data export functionality

### Long Term (Future Releases)
1. Backend API integration
2. Multi-user support
3. Mobile app
4. Advanced analytics
5. Community features

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Charts Not Showing?
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify localStorage has transaction data
- Ensure month/year selector is set correctly

### Calculations Seem Wrong?
- Check localStorage data format
- Verify TransactionService is loading all data
- Review GoalService calculation logic

### Velocity Alert Not Appearing?
- Add some transactions first
- Verify spending exceeds ₹100
- Check budget is set in localStorage
