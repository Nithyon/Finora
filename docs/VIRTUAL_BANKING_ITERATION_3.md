# Virtual Banking System - Iteration 3: Complete Spending Integration

**Date:** Updated  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Full account integration with spending system  
**Commits:** bc57b17, d3de004

## Overview

Completed Phase 3 of virtual banking development: **Full spending integration**. Users can now:
- Create virtual accounts
- Link transactions to specific accounts via account selector
- Filter spending by account on the spending page
- View per-account transaction history
- Transfer funds between accounts
- Manage all accounts from a single hub

## What's New in Iteration 3

### 1. Account Selection in Add Transaction Form

**File:** `app/add-transaction/page.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added account selector dropdown showing:
  - Virtual account name
  - Account type (Checking/Savings/Investment)
  - Current balance
  - Auto-selects first account if available
- Integrated with existing transaction form
- Styled to match spending form theme (dark gradient)
- Only shows if virtual accounts exist

**Code Changes:**
```tsx
// Added state for loading virtual accounts
const [virtualAccounts, setVirtualAccounts] = useState<BankAccount[]>([]);

// Load accounts from localStorage on component mount
useEffect(() => {
  if (user?.id) {
    const accountsKey = `finora_bank_accounts_${user.id}`;
    const savedAccounts = localStorage.getItem(accountsKey);
    if (savedAccounts) {
      const accounts = JSON.parse(savedAccounts);
      setVirtualAccounts(accounts);
      if (accounts.length > 0 && !formData.accountId) {
        setFormData(prev => ({ ...prev, accountId: accounts[0].id }));
      }
    }
  }
}, [user?.id]);
```

**UI Element:**
- Placed between Transaction Type and Date fields
- Conditional rendering (only shows if accounts exist)
- Styled with slate-800 background and purple focus border

### 2. Enhanced Account Selection on Spending Page

**File:** `app/spending/page.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added account filter dropdown at top of spending analysis
- Shows all virtual accounts with balances
- "All Accounts" option to view combined spending
- Real-time recalculation of spending when account changes
- Filters are persistent during session

**Features:**
- Displays each account with balance
- Shows account type for context
- Updates spending totals immediately
- Recalculates budget alerts per account

**Code Changes:**
```tsx
// Added state for account selection
const [virtualAccounts, setVirtualAccounts] = useState<BankAccount[]>([]);
const [selectedAccountId, setSelectedAccountId] = useState<string>('all');

// Load accounts from localStorage
useEffect(() => {
  if (user?.id) {
    const accountsKey = `finora_bank_accounts_${user.id}`;
    const savedAccounts = localStorage.getItem(accountsKey);
    if (savedAccounts) {
      const accounts = JSON.parse(savedAccounts);
      setVirtualAccounts(accounts);
    }
  }
}, [user?.id]);

// Filter transactions by selected account
txToUse.forEach((tx: any) => {
  if (selectedAccountId !== 'all' && tx.account_id && tx.account_id !== selectedAccountId) {
    return;
  }
  // ... process transaction
});
```

**UI Element:**
- Placed at top of spending dashboard
- Above Total Spending card
- Conditional (only shows if accounts exist)
- Styled to match dashboard theme

### 3. Transaction Model Enhancement

**Updated Transaction Structure:**
```typescript
{
  id: number;
  user_id: number;
  account_id: string;  // NEW - Links to virtual bank account
  amount: number;
  transaction_type: 'expense' | 'income';
  category: string;
  description: string;
  date: string;
  created_at: string;
}
```

**Backward Compatibility:**
- Existing transactions without `account_id` still work
- Defaults to account ID when not specified
- No migration needed for existing data

## Complete User Journey (Iteration 3)

### 1. **Create Virtual Account**
User navigates to `/accounts`:
- Clicks "Create Account" button
- Fills in account name, type
- Account is created with:
  - Unique account number (FINORA-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX)
  - Initial balance (custom or default)
  - Interest rate based on type
  - Creation timestamp

### 2. **Add Transactions to Accounts**
User navigates to `/add-transaction`:
- Form loads with virtual accounts dropdown
- First account auto-selected
- User can change to different account
- Fills in remaining fields (date, category, amount, etc.)
- Transaction saves with `account_id` reference

### 3. **View Spending by Account**
User navigates to `/spending`:
- Account filter dropdown appears at top
- Can select "All Accounts" or individual account
- Spending dashboard updates immediately:
  - Total spending recalculated
  - Category breakdown updated
  - Budget alerts filtered
- Stats cards show account-specific data

### 4. **View Account Details**
User navigates to `/accounts/[accountId]`:
- Sees full account information
- Transaction history filtered by account
- Can sort and filter transactions
- Views account summary
- Can perform deposit/withdraw/transfer

### 5. **Transfer Between Accounts**
User navigates to `/accounts/transfer`:
- Selects from account (auto-shows balance)
- Enters amount to transfer
- Selects to account
- Review summary before confirming
- Both accounts updated with transaction records

## Technical Architecture

### Data Storage

**Virtual Accounts:** `finora_bank_accounts_${userId}`
```json
[
  {
    "id": "acc_1704067200000",
    "userId": 1,
    "accountNumber": "FINORA-1234-5678-9012-3456",
    "accountType": "savings",
    "accountName": "Emergency Fund",
    "balance": 50000,
    "currency": "INR",
    "interestRate": 4.5,
    "createdAt": "2024-01-01T10:00:00Z",
    "isActive": true,
    "maxTransferLimit": 100000
  }
]
```

**Transactions:** `finora_transactions_${userId}`
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1704067200001,
    "user_id": 1,
    "account_id": "acc_1704067200000",
    "amount": 5000,
    "transaction_type": "income",
    "category": "üíº Salary",
    "description": "Monthly salary",
    "date": "2024-01-01",
    "created_at": "2024-01-01T10:00:00Z"
  }
]
```
