## 🎯 Optional Implementation

### Why It's Optional
- Core app works without it
- Spending/Budget/Analytics work independently
- Users don't see it unless they click Accounts
- No popup or forced onboarding
- Can be ignored completely

### When Real Banks Added
```
Current: Virtual Accounts (practice)
Future: Real Banks (actual accounts)

User can choose:
✅ Use both (virtual + real)
✅ Use only real (when available)
✅ Use only virtual (budget practice)
✅ Use neither (spend manually)
```
