## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Risk:** Backend not ready in time
  - **Mitigation:** Prioritize API development, use mock data in interim
  
- **Risk:** Performance issues at scale
  - **Mitigation:** Load testing, database optimization, caching

- **Risk:** Data integrity issues
  - **Mitigation:** Validation framework, health checks, backups

### Business Risks
- **Risk:** User adoption slow
  - **Mitigation:** Good UX, onboarding flow, feature education
  
- **Risk:** Feature creep delays launch
  - **Mitigation:** Lock feature set, create post-launch roadmap

- **Risk:** Competitive pressure
  - **Mitigation:** Focus on YNAB features, differentiation

### Operations Risks
- **Risk:** Monitoring/alerting fails
  - **Mitigation:** Configure multiple monitoring services
  
- **Risk:** Support queue backlog
  - **Mitigation:** Comprehensive documentation, FAQ, chatbot
  
- **Risk:** Security breach
  - **Mitigation:** Regular security audits, penetration testing
