## Troubleshooting

**Q: Account selector not showing?**  
A: Make sure you've created at least one virtual account in `/accounts` first.

**Q: Transactions not appearing in account?**  
A: Transactions created in add-transaction should auto-link. Check localStorage in browser dev tools.

**Q: Spending not updating when I change account?**  
A: Refresh the page or switch accounts twice. It should update immediately.

**Q: Transfer failed?**  
A: Check:
- Source account has enough balance
- Not transferring to same account
- Under daily limit (₹100,000)
