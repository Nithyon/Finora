## 💾 Optional vs. Mandatory

### Why It's Optional
- ✅ Not required for core app functionality
- ✅ Users can use Spending/Budget without accounts
- ✅ Great for practice, not essential for real usage
- ✅ Can add real banks later when needed

### User Communication
```
"Virtual accounts are optional - use them to practice 
budgeting. When we get funding, you'll be able to 
connect real bank accounts from Plaid, credit cards, 
and more."
```
